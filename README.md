# Get The Flights Out a.k.a. GTFO

This is a rails app to have a user be presented with top destination flights from airports near them, with Instagram pictures of those destinations (in order to intice the user how much fun it would be to GTFO).

### Basic userflow is as follows (version 1):
1. User signs up for an account with GTFO
2. User selects one of 5 defined airports
3. User selects one of 5 top destination flights from selected airport
4. User sees instagram pictures of that selected flight
5. User GTFO


### Improvements on the list
- Able to select any airport
- Able to automatically find closest airport (via browser geolocation)
- User can select theme of destination
- Invite friends to GTFO with them
- Book said flights
